# Isometric RPG/TBS Game
A 2D Isometric RPG game made with the power of [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net).

## Getting Started
Getting started is pretty simple, this project was made using JetBrains Rider.

### JetBrains Rider

3. To get the MonoGame Content Build manager installed, open a terminal and run the following command:

`dotnet tool install -g dotnet-mgcb`

4. **The build will fail at first.** Open a terminal window/cmd (Bottom status bar) in the projects directory, 
and type the following commands:

`dotnet restore`

`dotnet build`

*You may need to relaunch Rider to get symantic highlighting working again*
