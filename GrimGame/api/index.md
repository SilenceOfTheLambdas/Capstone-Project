# Welcome to GrimDoom

GrimDoom is the name of my 2D action role-playing game created using MonoGame, an open-source continuation of
Microsoftâ€™s old XNA framework. GrimDoom is a game in which players must fight off hordes of enemies, making use of
various weapons to achieve their goal. Every enemy killed provides the player with some money, which they can use to buy
upgrades for their weapons. I chose MonoGame as my engine of choice as it is a much lower level engine than Unity3D.
Path-finding, Collisions, Player layering, Enemy AI, and Graphical user interface components were all custom-made and
designed to allow developers to contribute to the project. The game itself is simple. It was the back-end systems that
have been the main focus of my development.
